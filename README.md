# Jesse optuna

Only works with the new GUI version of Jesse.
It will create a CSV with the parameter set, training metrics and testing metrics. 
You can use that CSV for further evaluation. For example you might want to filter parameter sets where the testing metrics are too low / sort by best testing score etc.

The config.yml should be self-explainatory.

Check jesse-hyperactive.log for errors during optimization.
